# Flux UI Free
- Flux UI is the official Livewire component library. This project uses the free edition, which includes all free components and variants but not Pro components.
- Use @verbatim`<flux:*>`@endverbatim components when available; they are the recommended way to build Livewire interfaces.
- IMPORTANT: Activate `fluxui-development` when working with Flux UI components.
